MergeLines.py (alt-m):
select lines and choose a separator. I could not find the same functionality in Notepad++ but maybe I overlooked.

UnmergeText.py (alt-e):
the inverse operation or MergeLines. A customer separator can be derived and if not found, chosen.

DeleteText.py (alt-d):
select text, press Alt-d and in the whole file it will be removed. Much faster than Replace with an empty string and making sure the checkbox with regex/normal/extended is right, etc.

DuplicateTab.py (alt-t):
Duplicate the text in the current tab as a new tab, immediately to the right and enable the same language syntax (if any)

SaveAllTabs.py (alt-s):
a loop through all open tabs. If unsaved, the code saves the tab if already saved earlier. If not yet saved, it is writting in a hardcoded folder on the hard drive.

AddArrows.py (alt-a):
Probably only useful to me :-) Serves a specific purpose of adding ==> text in the empty lines between paragraphes of text copied from an email.
