Scripts for usage in Notepad++. Setup first is needed to have PythonScript in Notepad++
After that, it becomes really powerful.

DeleteText.py: select text, press Alt-d and in the whole file it will be removed. Much faster than Replace with an empty string and making sure the checkbox with regex/normal/extended is right, etc.

MergeLines.py: select lines and choose a separator. I could not find the same functionality in Notepad++ but maybe I overlooked.

SaveAllTabs.py: a loop through all open tabs. If unsaved, the code saves the tab if already saved earlier. If not yet saved, it is writting in a hardcoded folder on the hard drive.

AddArrows.py: probably only useful to me :-) Serves a specific purpose of adding ==> text in the empty lines between paragraphes of text copied from an email.
